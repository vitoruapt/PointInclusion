# PointInclusion
Studies on point inclusion in general domains

This repository includes data, programs and algorithms related to the verification of point inclusion in general shaped domains.
The approach is concerned with analytical techniques only, hence no numerical approximations are tackled.

This work started in the early 90s' in the context of a PhD thesis but has undergone a series of updates and formalizations in several moments eversince.
As the work is now to be published, the programs and algorithms are also made public to the community.

There are main programs (script/function) that deomstrate the results and some specifi functions that implement the algorithms.
